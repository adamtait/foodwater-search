# foodwater-search

This is a tool for me to decide what to eat for dinner. My wonderful girlfriend, [Tam Thao Pham](http://nebulouskingdom.com) has graciously compiled a list of receipes that are healthy and easy to make. These receipes (and theory behind the food) is the diet that we maintain. You can read all about it at [foodwater.org](http://foodwater.org).

I found out while she was away from home that I'm not nearly as creative about picking receipes from ingredients as she is. This tool is supposed to help me solve that problem.
